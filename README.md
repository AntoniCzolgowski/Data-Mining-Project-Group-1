## About

Recent U.S. Presidential elections have been decided by small margins in a handful of key counties, yet most existing models focus on national-level indicators rather than the local dynamics that actually tip the scales. This project digs into county-level voting data across Pennsylvania, Michigan, and North Carolina to identify which counties exhibit the highest electoral volatility and what makes them volatile. We combine historical election returns (2016–2024) with census demographics and apply k-means clustering and association rule mining to uncover the socio-economic profiles behind these swing electorates. The goal is practical: figure out where small shifts in voter behavior carry the most weight, and what kinds of communities those places tend to be. Our findings are aimed at campaign strategists, political analysts, and anyone trying to understand why certain counties keep flipping while others stay do not.
